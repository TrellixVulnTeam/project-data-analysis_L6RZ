This a repo for my first data analysis.
Please go easy on me for this :)

In this repo:
.ipynb_checkpoints - just ignore this. Forgot to use git ignore
pro-data - virtual environtment
/pro-data/pyvenv - Python version used
chicago_crime.ipynb - data analysis for the project
crime - data from BigQuery public data: Chicago crime
location_cases - exported data from the dataset for map plotting
requirements.txt - dependencies for this project

Note:
The map for crime type and location is embedded in the chicago_crime.ipynb
It may not show up in GitHub or Jupyter Notebook.
Please use VS Code.
You can open it thru: https://vscode.dev/

Please provide your critics and suggestion! 
That would help me a lot.
