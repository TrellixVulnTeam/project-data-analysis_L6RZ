This a repo for my first data analysis.
Please go easy on me for this :)

In this repo:
.ipynb_checkpoints - just ignore this. Forgot to use git ignore
pro-data - virtual environtment
chicago_crime.ipynb - data analysis for the project
crime - data from BigQuery public data: Chicago crime
location_cases - exported data from the dataset for map plotting

Please provide your critics and suggestion! 
That would help me a lot.
